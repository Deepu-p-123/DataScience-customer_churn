#Customer Churn Prediction Machine Learning Model

This project contains a machine learning model to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The model is trained on a dataset of customer features and churn labels, and can be used to identify customers who are at risk of churning.

Motivation

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecommunications companies. It is estimated that the cost of acquiring a new customer is five times higher than the cost of retaining an existing customer. Therefore, it is important for telecommunications companies to be able to identify customers who are at risk of churning and take steps to retain them.

Model

The model in this project is a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a statistical method for modeling the probability of a binary outcome, such as whether or not a customer will churn. The model is trained on a dataset of customer features and churn labels. The customer features include demographic information, usage patterns, and customer satisfaction scores. The churn label indicates whether or not the customer churned within a certain period of time.
